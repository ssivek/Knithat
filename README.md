# KnitHAT: A Knitting Pattern Classifier and Recommender

A knitter's dilemma: That's a cute knitted hat in the store, but if you buy a ready-made hat, everyone will ask whether you made it. 

Want to find the pattern and make it yourself? Snap a photo and let KnitHAT find you some top-rated patterns on Ravelry that (may) match!

KnitHAT is based on a CNN trained on resnet50 using fast.ai. The webapp is hosted on [Render](https://knithat.onrender.com/).
